= Minimax-Regret
A method for approximate winner determination and an incremental elicitation protocol based on minimax regret.

* Add in the text the references to the appendix
* Explain and structure the appendix
* +++<del>+++cite conitzer (Bea)+++</del>+++
* +++<del>+++put back table 4 (Bea)+++</del>+++
* +++<del>+++about real data: high degree of similarity helps +++</del>+++
* m14n9 investigate the curve
** check with variation on n and m
* +++<del>+++suppress the discussion about speed of reduction: "We next wonder how fast the regret decreases..." (Bea)+++</del>+++
* distribution of the questions per voter (Bea)
** for each xp in Figure 2 how many qst for chair 
* take away message
** build profile
** reasonably low regret with reasonable nb of q
** pessimistic good in time and results
** asking q to the chair is not useful
** IC is harder than real data
* +++<del>+++ /small references+++</del>+++
* +++<del>+++ no cit to dataset+++</del>+++
* Keep 1.1+1e-6

* Similarity measure for preference rankings and use it as an explanation for the performance of the datasets.

* Rephrase the experimental section writing the hypotesis first
* Using \succeq^p_j(x) to denote the set of alternatives weakly worse than x can be confusing. Please consider using a different notation such as A^(\succeq^p_j,x).

* Experiments to elicite the scoring rule when knowing the full profile
** Plot of decresing regret
* Considerations on the distribution of the questions
