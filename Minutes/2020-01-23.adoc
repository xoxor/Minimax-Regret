== TODO code
* clean the strategies, remove the not used ones
* switch to the new Regret everywhere
* switch to the new Runner 
** add losses, create files

== What next?
* Consider the completion in the avg case not in the worst one
** difficult to compute
* would a min_avg work instead?

* lower bound on the improval of regret
** use this to show that it's not feasible
