== TODO

. two phase with tau on an instance (m,n) = (10,10)
* first ask k random questions about w
* then k' questions to voters using tau (we don't have the problem of comparing two taus that are most likely not compatible)

. optimize k

. invert the order of questions (first to voters and then to committee) and optimize k again

. try to reproduce the error and print the knowledge at that moment

. find a lambda for tau strategy

. two phase random

//-

* next step) optimize the pessimistic strategy

== Minors:
* shall we change s(x; v, w) to s^{v, w}(x) ?
* tau_1 and tau_2 can be called tau_profile and tau_weights
* change name to extreme completion strategy?
