== Meeting 1

*13/11/2018 - Paolo, Stefano, Olivier, Remzi, Beatrice*

=== Minimax regret over incomplete preferences
* Paolo presented Lu and Boutlier's work [1]

=== Goal
Extend this approach to a setting where both *preferences* and *rule* are unknown

=== Steps
. Optimization
** How to complete profiles 
** Maximize weights 
** What happens when weights are not separable?

. Elicitation 
** Which is the next question to ask? 
** Implies: Who to ask the next question?
*** committee: question of the type w1-w2>k(w2-w3)
*** one of the agents: question of the type a>b
**** which agent?

=== Next
* Meeting scheduled on the pass:q[<del>26th November at 10:30</del>] 7th December at 14:00
