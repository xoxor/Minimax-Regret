== Meeting 2

*07/12/2018 - Olivier, Paolo, Stefano, Beatrice*

=== Agenda
* Overview of minimax regret computation with fixed scoring vector with and without convex sequence assumption

=== Profile completion 
* We have a set of U~k~ alternatives for each voter. How an adversary can find a clever way to complete the profile and and choose a feasible assignment for weights?
** The weights assignment is dependent on the preference of all voters

=== Elicitation
Remaining in the convex assumption: 
* Which kind of questions ask
** to voters?
*** who is your best? who is your next best? and so on
*** pairwise questions 
** to the jury?
*** lambda difference ( w1-w2>Î»(w2-w3) )
