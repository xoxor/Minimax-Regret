*25/03/2019 - Olivier, Paolo, Beatrice*

=== Extreme Completion, reasoning on τs:
* The experiments show τ_1 positive and τ_2 negative
* Can τ_2 be positive?
** Req: s(ybar)>s(x*) ∀ v using wbar
** Req: ybar ≥ x* "on average"
** Let consider τ_2i i∈N using wbar and vbar except for i for which we minimize over v_i
*** It is negative and we like it.
* Can τ_1 be negative?
** Req: s(x*)>s(ybar) ∀ wbar using v
** Does x* need to dominate ybar ? 
*** example picture: x*=a=2*r1; ybar=b=5*r2. MR(a)=0.5; MR(b)=2.

=== Differences between Extreme Completion and Pessimistic strategy
* EC considers sets of questions at a time and then chooses among the set
* EC fixes x* and ybar

=== Strategies to test (Given (m,n))
* Strat_w 		: only asks about w
* Strat_v 		: only asks to voters
* Strat_(w1,v1) 	: asks 	1 question about w and 1 to voters
* Strat_(w10,v10) 	: 	10 	\\
* Strat_(w50,v50) 	: 	50 	\\
* Strat_(v1,w1) 	: asks 	1 question to voters and 1 about weights
* Strat_(v10,w10) 	: 	10	\\
* Strat_(v50,w50) 	: 	50	\\

=== For the next time:
* Present an example with (5,4) or (4,4)
